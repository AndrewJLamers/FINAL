<div class="ProjectText"><br>
<p>The craft brew industry has gained enormous momentum over the last 20 years.</p>
	<br>
<p>As fans of the industry, we wanted to develop an interactive method for viewing how the brewing industry has grown as well as potential variables in the distribution of growth.</p>
	<br>
<p> With our project focusing on the functionality of the display, rather than a comprehensive assessment of the statistics, we selected two variables we wanted to explore.  These variables were Median Income and the GINI Index.  As a measure of inequality, we wanted to see if the GINI Index would hinder growth of breweries; and where there is money you'll find economic develpment, hence median income.<br>We wanted to use the Ordinary Least Squares method, in conjuncture with our variables, to give an estimate for how many breweries should be in an area. With this, we needed to take the inverse of the GINI Index so that a higher score represented less income inequality rather than more.</p>
<p>While we appreciate the hundreds of variables that go into defining industry growth in an area, we were somewhat disappointed to see just how little the implications of these variables were in regards to the brewery count in each State.</p><br>
	<p>Even though our variables aren't a significant predictor for brewery counts in each State, it is still interesting to see just how the industry has grown, as well as how the GINI Index and Median Income levels for each State have changed over the years.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Thank you for taking the time to review our project and we hope you found it as interesting as we did.</p>
	<br><br>
	CHEERS!
